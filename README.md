# Car Safety Classification
This project is meant to use the car safety dataset and will look at the accuracy of different methods we could use to score and/or classify these cars as safe or unsafe.

## Motivation
The motivation of this project was to test out working with a K Nearest Neighbors Classification model, and to see if it could correctly classify cars based on some given properties.

The extended motivation of this project is to also practice some regression on variables used in a KNN to find the respective impact and importance of those particular properties.
